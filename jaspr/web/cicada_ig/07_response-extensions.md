## What Cicada Returns

### What cicada returns beyond the standard

The `$immds-forecast` response is a `Parameters` resource holding the ImmDS operation's own output — `evaluation` and `recommendation` — plus one `immunization` parameter per administered dose, so the literal `Immunization/<id>` references in the evaluations resolve inside a response with no server behind it.

The engine works out more than R4 and the US ImmDS IG have elements for. None of what follows changes a dose's validity or a series' status; each says something the standard resources cannot.

#### On the evaluation

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Target Dose Status](StructureDefinition-target-dose-status-ext.md) | Whether the target dose this dose was evaluated against ended up satisfied, not satisfied or skipped. R4 carries only`doseNumber`, derived from it, so a skipped target dose and a satisfied one otherwise read the same. |
| [Evaluation Sub-step Detail](StructureDefinition-evaluation-detail-ext.md) | The Chapter 6 sub-step outcomes behind the coded reason: age, both interval checks, conflict, and both vaccine checks, with the rule that failed. |
| [Engine and Supporting Data Version](StructureDefinition-engine-version-ext.md) | The engine build and the CDSi release that produced the answer. |

`doseStatusReason` carries **every** reason the evaluation found, not one. CDSi Table 6-31 sets the status "with evaluation reasons", plural, and R4 types the element `0..*`.

#### On each recommendation

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Series Type](StructureDefinition-series-type-ext.md) | Whether this recommendation came from the standard or the risk series group. |
| [Series Group](StructureDefinition-series-group-ext.md) | The series group the forecast is scoped to, per FORECASTVG-1. |
| [Antigen Needing a Dose](StructureDefinition-antigen-needing-dose-ext.md) | Which antigens of a multi-antigen group actually need the dose. |
| [Doses Remaining](StructureDefinition-doses-remaining-ext.md) | How many doses are left, or`Recurring`where the series never ends. |
| [Contributing Series Detail](StructureDefinition-series-detail-ext.md) | Per contributing series: its own status, its own four dates, and the component dates behind them — minimum and maximum age, the recommended age and interval windows, and the seasonal start. |
| [Engine and Supporting Data Version](StructureDefinition-engine-version-ext.md) | As above. |

`vaccineCode` carries the group code first and then each specific product that satisfies the next target dose. `contraindicatedVaccineCode` carries the products a contraindication ruled out. `description` carries the series' administrative guidance from the CDSi supporting data.

#### Forecast reasons

`forecastReason` uses the ImmDS ForecastReason code system where a concept exists, and the [Cicada Forecast Reason](CodeSystem-forecast-reason.md) code system otherwise. The ImmDS binding is example strength, so the four reasons ImmDS has no concept for — evidence of immunity, contraindication, unable to finish before the maximum age, below the minimum age to start — travel as a second coding rather than being dropped.

Two codes deserve a note.

**Complete for the season** is a deliberate deviation from CDSi, which has no such reason: its only seasonal reason is **past seasonal recommendation end date**. An adult who has had this year's influenza dose returns Complete, which without this is indistinguishable from complete for good. ACIP defines influenza and RSV recommendations by season, so the distinction is real. The series status is unchanged.

**Recommended by shared clinical decision-making** marks a series ACIP recommends by discussion rather than routinely, so an alert or a quality measure does not read it as a care gap. It is taken from CDC's own marking in the series name — four MenB and two COVID-19 series — and, for HPV, from the 27–45 year band CDC states in that series' guidance. Series whose guidance mentions shared decision-making for only part of their range are **not** marked, because they are routine for the rest and the supporting data has no scoped attribute to read.

#### Records that cannot be evaluated

CDSi evaluates a **vaccine dose administered**, and defines the assessment date as the current date. A dose dated after the assessment date has not been administered; a dose dated before birth was not administered to this patient. Neither can be evaluated, and neither is a clinical verdict, so neither becomes an invalid dose. They are excluded from evaluation and forecasting and reported in an `OperationOutcome` returned as an `outcome` parameter, coded from the [Cicada Data Integrity](CodeSystem-data-integrity.md) code system, carrying both conflicting dates and what to check. The `Immunization` still returns in its own parameter, so nothing is dropped silently.

The same `outcome` parameter also reports **two doses covering one antigen on one day**. That one is a warning only: both records may be real, and the engine cannot tell a record entered twice from a second injection, so each dose is still evaluated on its own merits. It is matched on the antigen rather than the product, because the case that actually happens is a combination given beside one of its components — Pediarix and Pentacel are different CVX codes that both carry diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and polio, and a check comparing products would see nothing.
